The database includes both real-measured data, and simulated time-delay data, as well as ground-truth client position information, which can be used for validation and performance analysis. The PE code is designed to process the database data format and produce estimates of the mobile WiFi receiver position within the indoor venue.  The database may be used for the development, validation and performance analysis of additional positioning engines.  This kind of WiFi client PE enables an unlimited number of clients to estimate the position and navigate within the Wi-Fi network coverage area.

This is meant to replace the existing CarbonBlack AppControl kernel module.This kernel module was created in a much more generic manner to fulfill AppControl's file protection/access control oriented features that is critical to their exception list handling approach to access controls.However the kernel module could be used for different access control techniques, it's really up to the userspace implementation.The kernel module may be useful for other products that might have a strong business want, and would likely utilize a subset of the features to provide access controls. Example subset usage may be geared towards protecting specific files and processes that is owned by the product using this (anti-tampering) or protecting other some subset of files and processes not owned by the product.The main business reason for AppControl to using this kernel module is to logically separate business logic away from the kernel landscape while protecting proprietary work. Additionally this kernel module provides more accurate data, performance optimizations and more options to improve the overall security efficacy of the AppControl product.The longer term goal which is not in this project, is to eventually utilize BPF (extended Berkley Packet Filter) to provide access controls when they become more widely available for targeted distros.
